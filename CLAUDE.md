# CLAUDE.md

This repo contains standalone HTML/CSS/JS widgets and overlays for live streaming (Twitch/OBS).

## Structure
- Each project lives in its own folder at the root.
- Widgets are single-file HTML pages meant to be loaded as browser sources in OBS.

## Conventions
- Language: French UI text (labels, badges, buttons).
- Style: Dark, glassmorphism aesthetic with transparent backgrounds for OBS overlay compatibility.
- No build tools or dependencies — plain HTML/CSS/JS.
